The projects on here are a combination of team and individual projects that I worked on during the bootcamp and some small personal projects that I have been working on since. 

Thank you for visiting my profile. After spending 9 years in the military and then 12 years in health and fitness
I started my journey into development with the School of Code in May 2022. I have learnt a huge amount on my journey so far, and I am excited to see where this newfound adventure will take me.
